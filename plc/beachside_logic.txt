PROPOSED COMMUNICATION SEQUENCE..							
STORAGE TO RECEIVING SEQUENCE:	Cycle Steps					ERP MODBUS Actions	
Sequence Step 1	PLC CYCLE RUNNING signal on					Check if this is HIGH before setting signals.  Report error if not. 	
Sequence Step 2	ERP System turns on PICK BIN XX & TO RECEIVING STA 1 digital signals					Triggered by Material Receipt Stock Entry (before Submit) - Set PICK BIN XX and TO RECEIVING STA 1 high	
Sequence Step 3	PLC communicates to STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT 						
Sequence Step 4	    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT Starts Pick to Receiving Routine (from home position)						
Sequence Step 5	PLC turns on PICK TO RECEIVING IN PROCESS digital signal					Wait for PICK ERROR or TO RECEIVING IN PROCESS set HIGH (timeout default 60 seconds or script parameter WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS)	
Sequence Step 6	ERP System turns off PICK BIN XX & TO RECEIVING STA 1 digital signals					Set PICK BIN XX and TO RECEIVING STA 1 to LOW	
Sequence Step 7	    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT completes Pick and Place Routine (returns to home position)						
Sequence Step 8	PLC turns off PICK TO RECEIVING IN PROCESS digital signal					Wait for PICK ERROR or PICK TO RECEIVING IN PROCESS	
Sequence Step 9	PLC Pulse on PICK TO RECEIVING COMPLETE digital signal (1-sec.)					Wait for PICK ERROR or PICK TO RECEIVING COMPLETE	
Sequence Step 10	    Receiving Operator manually removes BIN from Gravity Conveyor 1					If no PICK ERROR, submit the Stock Entry document.	
Sequence Step 11	    Receiving Operator manually places Stock Entry parts in BIN Received from Storage					If a PICK ERROR occurs, the submit will be rolled back and the Mateial Receipt document will remain in "Saved" status.  	
Sequence Step 12	    Receiving Operator Manually places BIN Received from Storage onto Gravity Conveyor 2					Create a Modbus Event logging the error	
RECEIVING TO STORAGE SEQUENCE:							
Sequence Step 13	PLC CYCLE RUNNING						
Sequence Step 14	PLC Detects R1 CONV 2 BIN PRESENT PE					How do I know which BIN is to receive the inventory?  I need that information to pick the warehouse location for the Material Transfer.  	
Sequence Step 15	PLC Reads BIN RFID Tag and records BIN Number (Should be same as BIN # Picked to Receiving)						
Sequence Step 16	PLC communicates BIN Location to STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT 						
Sequence Step 17	    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT Starts Pick from RECEIVING to STORAGE Routine						
Sequence Step 18	PLC turns on PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS digital signal					Wait for PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS to be HIGH	
Sequence Step 19	    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT completes Pick and Place Routine (returns to home position)					Generate a Material Transfer Stock Entry document.	
Sequence Step 20	PLC turns off PICK TO STORAGE WAREHOUSE IN PROCESS digital signal					Save the Material Transfer Stock Entry document when PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS is HIGH	
Sequence Step 21	PLC Pulse on PICK TO STORAGE WAREHOUSE COMPLETE digital signal (1-sec.)					If no PICK ERROR, Submit the Material Transfer Stock Entry document.	
Sequence Step 22	Return to Sequence Step 1						
	NOTE: A PICK ERROR digital signal indicates an incompleted sequence 					If PICK ERROR, roll back the submit of the Material Transfer Stock Entry Document	
OR	and should be treated as an INCOMPLETE ORDER in the ERP SYSTEM					Create a Modbus Event logging the error. 	
							
STORAGE TO PICK AND PACK SEQUENCE:						ERP MODBUS Actions	
Sequence Step 1	PLC CYCLE RUNNING					Check if this is HIGH before setting signals.  Report error if not. 	
Sequence Step 2	ERP System turns on PICK BIN XX & TO PICK & PACK  STA 1 digital signals					Triggered by Pick List (before Submit) - Set PICK BIN XX and TO ASSEMBLY STA 1 high	
Sequence Step 3	PLC communicates to STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT 						
Sequence Step 4	    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT Starts Pick BIN XX from STORAGE to PICK & PACK Routine						
Sequence Step 5	PLC turns on PICK TO PICK & PACK IN PROCESS digital signal					Wait for PICK ERROR or TO ASSEMBLY IN PROCESS set HIGH (timeout default 60 seconds or script parameter WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS)	
Sequence Step 6	ERP System turns off PICK BIN XX & TO PICK & PACK STA 1 digital signals					Set PICK BIN XX and TO ASSEMBLY STA 1 to LOW	
Sequence Step 7	STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT completes Pick from STORAGE to PICK & PACK Routine						
Sequence Step 8	PLC turns off PICK TO PICK & PACK IN PROCESS digital signal					Wait for PICK ERROR or PICK TO ASSEMBLY IN PROCESS	
Sequence Step 9	PLC Pulse on PICK TO PICK & PACK COMPLETE digital signal (1-sec.)					Wait for PICK ERROR or PICK TO ASSEMBLY COMPLETE	
Sequence Step 10	    PICK & PACK Operator manually packs parts from BIN/S XX into Shipping Bin					If no PICK ERROR, submit the Stock Entry document.	
Sequence Step 11	    PICK & PACK Operator manually places BIN XX on gravity Conveyor 4 (Return to Storage)					If a PICK ERROR occurs, the submit will be rolled back and the Mateial Receipt document will remain in "Saved" status.  	
Sequence Step 12	    PICK & PACK Operator manually places Shipping Bin with all packed parts on Conveyor 6					Create a Modbus Event logging the error	
Sequence Step 13	PLC detects POWER CONV 5 INFEED PE and turns on Conveyor 5 to transfer Shipping bin to Shipping Station						
PICK AND PACK TO STORAGE SEQUENCE:							
Sequence Step 14	PLC CYCLE RUNNING					How do I know which BIN is to receive the inventory?  I need that information to pick the warehouse location for the Material Transfer.  	
Sequence Step 15	PLC Detects R3 CONV 4 BIN PRESENT PE						
Sequence Step 16	PLC Reads BIN RFID Tag and records BIN Number						
Sequence Step 17	PLC communicates BIN Location to STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT 						
Sequence Step 18	    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT Starts Pick Routine (from home position)					Wait for PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS to be HIGH	
Sequence Step 19	PLC turns on PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS digital signal					Generate a Material Transfer Stock Entry document.	
Sequence Step 20	    STORAGE WAREHOUSE ROBOT completes Pick and Place Routine (returns to home position)					Save the Material Transfer Stock Entry document when PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS is HIGH	
Sequence Step 21	PLC turns off PICK TO STORAGE IN PROCESS digital signal					If no PICK ERROR, Submit the Material Transfer Stock Entry document.	
Sequence Step 22	PLC Pulse on PICK TO STORAGE COMPLETE digital signal (1-sec.)						
Sequence Step 23	Return to Sequence Step 1					If PICK ERROR, roll back the submit of the Material Transfer Stock Entry Document
